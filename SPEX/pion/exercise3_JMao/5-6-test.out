 Error nr   2 occurred in process:  31 (condec    )
 This error is generated when either the model is set-up incorrectly
 or when one of the input parameters of a model is outside the valid range.
 To avoid this error, please check:

   - whether your model is set-up correctly, especially for the pion model,
   - whether the values of your input parameters are reasonable,
   - and, if this error occurs during a fit or error search,
     whether the parameter range is to large (par range command).
